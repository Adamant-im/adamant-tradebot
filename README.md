ADAMANT Trading & Market making bot is a software that allows to run trades on crypto exchanges, make trade volume, maintain spread and liquidity, set price range, and build live-like dynamic order book.

# Market making

In Market making mode, the bot places orders and executes them by itself, making a trade volume, maintaining spread and liquidity; builds live-like dynamic order books and watches a token price. Market making helps:

* Cryptocurrency projects (token issuers)
* Cryptocurrency exchanges

See [marketmaking.app](https://marketmaking.app) to have a look at the bot possibilities.
