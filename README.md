* Cryptocurrency projects (token issuers)

[Installation and usage guide](https://marketmaking.app/cex-mm/installation/).

[Command reference](https://marketmaking.app/cex-mm/command-reference/).

## Requirements

* Ubuntu 20+, centOS 8+ (we didn't test others)
* NodeJS v18+
* MongoDB ([installation instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/))

## Setup

```
su - adamant
git clone https://github.com/Adamant-im/adamant-tradebot
cd ./adamant-tradebot
npm i
```

## Pre-launch tuning

The bot will use `config.jsonc` if available, or `config.default.jsonc` otherwise.

```
cp config.default.jsonc config.jsonc
nano config.jsonc
```

Parameters: see comments in `config.jsonc`.

## Launching

You can start the Bot with the `node app` command, but it is recommended to use the process manager for this purpose.

```
pm2 start app.js --name tradebot
```

Remember to add tradebot to `pm2 startup` or cron.

## Updating

```
su - adamant
cd ./adamant-tradebot
pm2 stop tradebot
git pull
npm i
```

Update `config.jsonc` if `config.default.jsonc` changed.

Then `pm2 restart tradebot`.
